# Stack Support Account

Every Stack instance includes a built-in **Stack Support** account. This account exists so our team can help with troubleshooting, setup, and resolving technical issues when necessary.

---

## Why Does It Exist?

- To help diagnose and fix issues on your instance if you report a problem  
- To verify that your setup is working as expected after support requests  
- To provide basic troubleshooting without needing you to create a separate account for us

> **The Stack Support account never uses your data for any other purpose.**  
> It’s only used for resolving issues or providing requested help.

---

## What Happens If You Click It?

Clicking on the **Stack Support** profile in your instance will take you to an informational page that explains:

- Why the account exists  
- Helpful links, like [Support](https://stack.events/support) and the [Docs](https://docs.stack.events)
- How to reach out if you need further assistance

---

## Can I Delete or Edit It?

No. The account is a required part of every Stack instance to ensure our support team can provide help when needed. You can safely ignore it unless you need assistance.
