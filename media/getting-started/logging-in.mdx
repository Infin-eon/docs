# Logging In

To log in to Stack, you’ll first need access to a registered Stack instance.

---

## Step 1: Purchase a Stack Instance

If your school or organization hasn’t purchased a Stack instance yet, visit the [Plans](/support/plans-overview) page or [Contact Support](https://stack.events/support) to get started.

Once purchased, you’ll receive:

- A custom URL for your instance (e.g. `yourname.stack.events`)
- A temporary admin login and password

---

## Step 2: Open Your Instance URL

Head to your unique Stack subdomain — for example:  
`https://demo.stack.events` or the link provided in your setup email.

On the login screen:

- Enter your email address
- Use the **temporary password** we provided
- You’ll be prompted to reset your password after first login

> If your preferred subdomain is taken, you’ll receive the closest available `.stack.events` link.

---

## For Admins

Admins receive their login credentials via the welcome email. Once logged in, you’ll be able to:

- Configure your instance
- Add students and staff
- Manage dev tools, submissions, and equipment

If you're unsure where to start, visit the [Dev Tools Overview](/admin/dev-menu-overview).

---

## For Students

If you’re a student, your teacher or advisor will give you the link to your school’s Stack instance — something like `https://yourprogram.stack.events`.

Just go to that link and:

- Enter your **school email**
- Enter the **password you created during signup**

If you haven’t signed up yet, follow the instructions in our  
[Signing Up Guide](/media/getting-started/signing-up).

If you're having trouble logging in, you can reset your password [here](/media/getting-started/resetting-password), or contact your advisor for help.

---

## Forgot Your Password?

You have two options:

1. **Contact Your Admin**  
   Ask your school’s advisor or media teacher to reset or resend your credentials.

2. **Reset It Yourself**  
   Use the **Forgot Password** link on your login page and follow our  
   [Reset Your Password](/media/getting-started/resetting-password) guide.

If you're still having trouble, visit [Support](https://stack.events/support) and we’ll help you get back in.
