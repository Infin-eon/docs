# Signing Up

Whether you're an admin getting your program started or a student joining your class, here's how to create your account on Stack.

---

## For Admins

If you're a media teacher, advisor, or program lead:

1. Go to [stack.events](https://stack.events)
2. Click the **Get Started** button
3. Select a plan and complete the registration form

Once you've subscribed, you’ll receive:

- Your own Stack instance (e.g. `yourname.stack.events`)
- A full admin dashboard to manage students, submissions, equipment, and more

Already signed up? Head to your custom URL and [log in](/media/getting-started/logging-in).

> **Note:** Only admins can create a new instance — students must join through their teacher’s link.

## For Students

If you're a student, your teacher will send you a direct link to your school's instance — something like:

[`https://demo.stack.events`](https://demo.stack.events)

### Here’s what to do:

1. Open the link your teacher or advisor gave you  
2. Scroll to the bottom of the login screen  
3. Click **Sign Up**

You’ll be taken to the registration form.

## Creating Your Student Account

After clicking **Sign Up**, follow these steps:

1. **Enter your school email**  
   Use the email address your admin provided (usually your school-issued email).

2. **Check your inbox**  
   You’ll receive a confirmation email. Click the verification link to continue.

3. **Create your password**  
   After verifying, you’ll be asked to set your password.

4. **Choose your class**  
   If your admin hasn’t pre-assigned you to a class, you’ll be prompted to select one from a dropdown list.

Once complete, you’ll be redirected to your student dashboard.

## Having Trouble?

- Make sure the link ends in `.stack.events`
- Ask your teacher if your email has been imported into the student system
- Or visit [Support](https://stack.events/support) for help

Once your account is created, check out the [Logging In](/media/getting-started/logging-in) guide.
