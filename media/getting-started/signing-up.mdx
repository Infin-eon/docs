# Signing Up

Whether you're an admin getting your program started or a student joining your class, here's how to create your account on Stack.

---

## For Admins

If you're a media teacher, advisor, or program lead:

1. Go to [stack.events](https://stack.events)
2. Click the **Get Started** button
3. Select a plan and complete the registration form

Once you've subscribed, you'll receive:

- Your own Stack instance (e.g. `yourname.stack.events`)
- A full admin dashboard to manage students, submissions, equipment, and more

Already signed up? Head to your custom URL and [log in](/media/getting-started/logging-in).

> **Note:** Only admins can create a new instance — students must join through their teacher’s link.

## For Students

If you're a student, your teacher will send you a direct link to your school's instance, such as:

[`https://demo.stack.events`](https://demo.stack.events)

Here’s what to do:

1. Open the link from your teacher or advisor  
2. Scroll down on the login page  
3. Click **Sign Up** at the bottom

> **Important:** You can’t create an account without this link. Ask your teacher if you don’t have it.
