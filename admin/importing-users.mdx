# Importing Users

Stack lets you quickly bulk upload student accounts using a simple CSV file.

Whether it's the start of a new year or you're just adding more students, here's how to import users the right way.

---

## Step 1: Format Your CSV

Your file **must follow this format** with these two exact columns:

```csv
student_id,email
42069,blake.johnson@stackhs.org
12345,emma.thompson@stackhs.org
86753,sarah.lee@stackhs.org
90013,tyler.nguyen@stackhs.org
50505,grace.henderson@stackhs.org
13370,lucas.martinez@stackhs.org
24680,julia.kim@stackhs.org
77777,noah.patel@stackhs.org
10101,madison.clark@stackhs.org
88888,elijah.brown@stackhs.org
```

You can [download our sample CSV](https://demo.stack.events/assets/data/sample_data.csv) to use as a template.

We recommend creating your CSV using:

- [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com) — free and shareable
- [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel)
- Or any spreadsheet editor that supports CSV export

## Step 2: Upload Your File
To access the import tool, go to `yourname.stack.events/dev/users/import` or open the **Dev** menu → **Manage Users** → **Import Users**.

Upload your file in the field provided. You’ll then see a preview of the first 10 rows of your data.

---

## Step 3: Choose Whether to Wipe Previous Imports

You'll see a checkbox labeled:

**“Wipe all previous imported users”**  
This deletes every previously imported student record before adding your new list.

**Use this if:**

- You’re starting fresh (new semester, new year, new class)
- You want to remove *all* existing imported students and replace them

**Leave it unchecked if:**

- You’re adding a few more students to an existing list
- You want to keep your current imports and just add more

---
## Dangers of Wiping All Users

<Danger>
If you check the **wipe all previous users** box, **none of your existing students will be able to sign up or log in** — unless they’re included in the new CSV.

Once wiped, those students will see an error that their email isn't recognized during sign-up.

Use this only when you're truly resetting your user list — like at the start of a new year.
</Danger>

---

## Step 4: Preview & Import

After uploading, Stack will show you a preview table of your CSV contents (first 10 rows).

Check that:

- Every row has a valid `student_id` and `email`
- No fields are missing or malformed

Then hit **Import All** to finalize.

## After Importing

Imported users can now go to your instance URL and create an account using their assigned email address.

If a student can’t sign up:

- Double-check their email is listed in the import
- Try re-uploading your CSV
- Make sure you're using the correct instance subdomain
