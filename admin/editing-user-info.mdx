# Editing User Info

You can update any student's information by visiting their profile edit page.

---

## How to Access

You can either:

- Go to `yourname.stack.events/dev/users/edit?id=theusersid`
- Or navigate to the **Dev Menu → Manage Users**, click the three-dot menu next to any user, then select **Edit**

---

## Editable Fields

Here’s what you can update:

- **First Name**  
- **Last Name**
- **Email**
- **Role** — [See all roles here](/dev/users/roles)
- **Class** — select from your program’s available classes  
- **Password** — leave blank if you don’t want to change it

Changing a user's email or class will immediately affect what they see and what tools they can access.

## Editing Classes On the Fly

<Tip>
Need to add or rename a class? In the class dropdown, click the little **notepad icon** ✎ to open the Class Manager.
</Tip>

You can create, rename, or delete classes right from there — no need to leave the page.
